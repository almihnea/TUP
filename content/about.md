Well, hello there!

My name is Mihnea, I was born in '99 in Romania and I currently work as a C&OSS Engineer for a telecommunication-based company.

I very much enjoy to tinker with linux based hosting and networking. I delve into BSD a bit too, by the means of OpnSense.

I am working on building a [VzBot](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330) 3D printer, for my master's degree/thesis.

Most of my homelab is based around PROXMOX, RHEL/RHEL-based and Debian machines, three physical servers + one VPS (Hetzner), a 24 port managed switch, other adjacent hardware (i.e. AP, UPS, 19" rack, etc.). I am fortunate enough to have the ability of actually managing two physical locations plus the VPS, making a kind of a triangle network, this really opens up some amazing opportunities.

Favourite books are the **Red Rising** trilogy and sequels. Favourite TV Show is **House M.D.** Favourite band is **Opeth**. I also enjoy gardening, especially for hot-sauce making purposes and try to live a bit more sustainably.

Currently reading the **Dune** series and playing (too much) **Baldurs's Gate 3**.
